# A Web Worker API example app
For TypeScript devs using VSCode.

It is based in this repo:

	https://github.com/mdn/simple-web-worker/tree/main/web-workers/simple-web-worker

But with the following changes:
- Converted JS to TS with types, classes, MVC separation, smaller methods.
- Added VSCode config files for latest JS module and code generation.
- Changed HTML and CSS to a more reasonable GUI.
- Added button to explicitly start the web worker.

# Running

TypeScript should be globally installed. You can do that with:

	`npm -g install typescript`

As a webserver, you can install http-server globally with:

	`npm -g install http-server`
